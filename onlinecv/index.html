                            <p>During the spring of my Senior year, I came up with the idea to 
                            create a website where I could share quick financial facts with others
                            who don't have a lot of time to do their own technical analysis.  My
                            goal was to provide high quality technical analysis for people who want 
                            quick and easy TA for their financial decisions. I am using machine learning
                            models to provide extra insight.

                        <h4>Backend Engineer</h4>
                        <p>Ames, Iowa</p>
                        <p>During the spring of my Junior year, I had the opportunity to work on
                        a group project for COM S 309.  This class focused a lot of the process of seeing
                        a project through from beginning to end.  The project was heavily focused on
                        web development.  My personal focus was on developing the map features to visually
                        see where rental properties are located.  My other focus was on database and backend
                        development processes.  This project was completed with the help of two team
                        members and various API's.</p>

                        <h4>Founder</h4>
                        <p>Ames, Iowa</p>
                        <p>Exploring Iowa was a website I founded with three other people.  The website was
                        focused on sharing interesting locations around the state of Iowa.  My main focuses
                        for this project were on web development and business development.  Since almost all
                        of my co-founders were photographers, our site was visually appealing.  My co-founders
                        graduated and the project was too much for me to keep up with during my studies.  Though
                        there was no academic journals used in this project, but there was three other team members.</p>

                        <p>Ames, Iowa</p>
                        <p>Opia was a Android development project.  This project was a game similar to Connect Four,
                        with a few more complexities.  The application was eventually used to teach middle school and
                        high school students about programming and encourage them to consider engineering majors.  My
                        focus for this project was mainly on user experience.  This project was the starting block for my
                        interest in developing high quality user experiences for all of my projects.  This project was
                        completed with the help of five other team members.</p>
